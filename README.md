This platform is a virtual shopping complex where anyone can create their own shop and customers can purchase from any shop. Shopkeepers can register, set up their shop, and add products. Once a shop is created, it is listed on the platform, making it accessible to customers. Shopkeepers only need to manage their inventory and process orders.

Customers can browse through a variety of shops, select their desired products, and choose a delivery optionâ€”either pickup from the shop or home delivery. The shopkeeper handles order fulfillment based on the chosen delivery method.

The platform is divided into three sections:

1.Customer Section: Customers can explore shops, purchase products, and specify delivery preferences.
2.Shopkeeper Section: Shopkeepers can create shops, manage products, view daily reports on orders and profits, and track business performance.
3.Admin Section: Admins oversee the platform, ensuring smooth operation, managing users, and resolving issues.
